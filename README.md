Welcome to the GitHub repo of **Thomas' AdventuRe**, my blog on `R`. I created this blog using `blogdown`, a superb `R` package that let's you built static website from (R)markdown files.

The blog is currently hosted on [thomas-neitmann.netlify.com](https://thomas-neitmann.netlify.com/). Have fun exploring it!
