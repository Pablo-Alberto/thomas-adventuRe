      <title>A case for the assign() function</title>

      <description>In R, assign() is one of those functions that common wisdom says you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using. My aim in this blog post is to convince you that assign() can be very handy.
The pharmaceutical industry, which I work in, is still SAS dominated so my primary data source at work are .sas7bdat files. Thus, whenever I use R the first thing I have to do is read in those files.</description>

      <description>My name is Thomas Neitmann. I am a R enthusiast currently working for Swiss pharmaceutcial company Roche as a Statistical Programmer Analyst for late-phase clinical trials in oncology.
My R journey began in 2014 when a coworker told me to run an R script to &amp;ldquo;analyze some data&amp;rdquo;. Having never programmed before at that time I was overwhelmed. But I took on the challenge and soon realized the power and joy of programming.</description>

      <title>dplyr::count()</title>

      <description>If you frequently use chains like this
data %&amp;gt;%group_by(var1, var2) %&amp;gt;%summarise(n = n())consider using
count(data, var1, var2)instead. It produces the same output, you need to type less and the code is more expressive.
By default, the column containing the count will be named n. Want to change that? Simply set the name parameter of count(), e.g.
data(iris)dplyr::count(iris, Species, name = &amp;#34;n_flowers&amp;#34;)## # A tibble: 3 x 2## Species n_flowers## &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;## 1 setosa 50## 2 versicolor 50## 3 virginica 50</description>

      <title>Dumbbell charts with ggcharts</title>

      <description>library(ggcharts)library(dplyr)library(gapminder)data(gapminder)I am very pleased to announce that my ggcharts package has a new feature: dumbbell_chart().
To showcase this new function I will use the gapminder dataset which contains countries&amp;rsquo; population counts from 1952 to 2017. This dataset is in long format. In order for dumbbell_chart() to work properly the data has to be in wide format, though. So, first a bit of data wrangling.
gapminder_wide &amp;lt;- gapminder %&amp;gt;%mutate(pop = pop / 1e6) %&amp;gt;%filter(year %in% c(1952, 2007)) %&amp;gt;%tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = country,names_from = year,values_from = pop,names_prefix = &amp;#34;pop_&amp;#34;)gapminder_wide## # A tibble: 142 x 3## country pop_1952 pop_2007## &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;## 1 Afghanistan 8.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of adding your favorite ggplot2 theme to every data visualization you create in R? Then I have a solution for you!
Before you start to create any plots call the theme_set() function with your favorite theme as first argument, e.g.
library(ggplot2)theme_set(theme_minimal())That will ensure all plots you subsequently create will use this theme unless you add a different one.
data(&amp;#34;mtcars&amp;#34;)ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg, color = wt)) +geom_point()Very handy for lazy people like me.</description>

      <description>If you find yourself repeatedly writing the same ggplot2 code to create a data visualization in R, then it&amp;rsquo;s time to put your code into a function.
You may start out with an implementation similar to this one.
library(ggplot2)data(&amp;#34;mtcars&amp;#34;)scatter_plot &amp;lt;- function(data, x, y) {ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +geom_point()}That won&amp;rsquo;t work though.
scatter_plot(mtcars, hp, mpg)## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object &#39;hp&#39; not foundIf you call this function, R will look for a variable called hp rather than looking for a column with that name inside the data frame you passed as the first argument.</description>

      <title>Renaming files in a git repository</title>

      <description>If you are using git for your data science project (which you should!), you have to be careful when renaming a file.
If you simply rename the file in your OS file browser, git would interpret this as deleting the file with the old name and creating a new one with the new name. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be linked in any way and you&amp;rsquo;d essentially loose the history of that file.</description>

      <title>Is a library the same thing as a package?</title>
      <link>/posts/is-a-library-the-same-thing-as-a-package/</link>

      <guid>/posts/is-a-library-the-same-thing-as-a-package/</guid>
      <description>In R you use the library() function to load a package. Thus, surely a package and a library must be the same thing, right?
Actually no, they are not!
So, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between the two? A library is nothing but a folder on your computer in which installed packages are saved. Just like a real library that contains books. It is merely a container. A library on its own is useless.</description>

      <description>I am super exciting to share with you my recent &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; of the ggtext R package.
I had looked for a solution to color individual words in the title of a ggplot2 data visualization and ggtext provided me with a great solution for doing just that (and more).
So, how does it work? Have a look at this example:
library(ggplot2)library(dplyr)library(gapminder)data(gapminder)gapminder %&amp;gt;%filter(continent %in% c(&amp;#34;Africa&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Europe&amp;#34;)) %&amp;gt;%group_by(continent, year) %&amp;gt;%summarise(population = sum(pop / 1e9)) %&amp;gt;%ggplot(aes(year, population, color = continent)) +geom_line(size = 1.</description>

      <title>Creating excel files from R using openxlsx</title>

      <description>Yesterday I had to share data with some internal stakeholders in excel format. Why excel? Well, I guess if you are not a &amp;ldquo;data professional&amp;rdquo;, then that&amp;rsquo;s the easiest format to work with.
So, I started R, read in the dataset, did some data wrangling and then wanted to write the data to a xlsx file. I heard great things about the openxlsx package so I used it for the first time.</description>
