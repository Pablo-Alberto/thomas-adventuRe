      <title>How does the pipe operator actually work?</title>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that the pipe operator %&amp;gt;% from the {magrittr} package—made famous by its use in {dplyr}—revolutionized R. Using %&amp;gt;% you can chain together multiple functions to create pipelines for your data. That way you can write highly expressive code and mitigate the need to define intermediate variables for each step of you data processing. But how does %&amp;gt;% actually work? If you think about it, %&amp;gt;% does something quite astonishing: it applies the function on its right to the expression of its left.</description>

      <title>{mdthemes} is on CRAN: markdown powered themes for {ggplot2}</title>

      <guid>/posts/mdthemes-is-on-cran-markdown-powered-themes-for-ggplot2/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to announce that {mdthemes}—my second (public) R package—is now available from CRAN. {mdthemes} adds support for rendering text as markdown to the themes from {ggplot2}, {ggthemes}, {hrbrthemes}, {tvthemes} and {cowplot}. It contains 55 themes in total. All themes start with md_ followed by the name of the original theme, e.g. md_theme_bw().
I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to put this package on CRAN for quite some time. However, before submitting I had to wait until {ggtext}—which does all the hard work for {mdthemes}—was available from CRAN.</description>

      <title>Calculating change from baseline in R</title>

      <description>As a statistical programmer working on clinical trials data I frequently have to calculate change from baseline. In clinical trials baseline is typically defined as the last measurement prior to a clinical trial subject receiving any study drug. Change from baseline is frequently calculated for laboratory measurements, e.g. hemoglobin concentration in blood.
SAS is still the standard used to program datasets in the pharmaceutical industry but R is catching up. Recently, I derived change from baseline for the first time in R.</description>

      <title>Enhance your {ggplot2} data visualizations with {ggtext}</title>

      <description>I am super exciting to share with you my recent &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; of the {ggtext} R package.
I had looked for a solution to color individual words in the title of a {ggplot2} data visualization and {ggtext} provided me with a great solution for doing just that (and more).
So, how does it work? Have a look at this example:
library(ggplot2)library(dplyr)data(biomedicalrevenue, package = &amp;#34;ggcharts&amp;#34;)plot &amp;lt;- biomedicalrevenue %&amp;gt;%filter(company %in% c(&amp;#34;Roche&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Novartis&amp;#34;)) %&amp;gt;%ggplot(aes(year, revenue, color = company)) +geom_line(size = 1.</description>

      <title>{ggcharts 0.2.0} is on CRAN</title>
      <link>/posts/ggcharts-0-2-0-is-on-cran/</link>

      <description>Introduction A week ago the second release of my {ggcharts} package was published on CRAN. {ggcharts} aims to get you to your desired plot faster. It provides a high-level interface for creating common plots using {ggplot2} and does the heavy lifting for you. The resulting plots are ggplot objects so you can further tweak them using any {ggplot2} function.
Major new feature: themes The major focus of version 0.2.0 was adding themes to the package.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the ggcharts CRAN Downloads. Part 2: Data Visualization</title>

      <description>Introduction In part 1 of this post I described how I got data about the ggcharts CRAN downloads. In this follow-up post I will walk you through how to turn this data into an informative visualization using ggplot2 and patchwork.
library(ggplot2)library(patchwork)Daily Downloads The first plot will show the daily downloads over time. I will use a line chart for that purpose. Remember from part 1 that the daily_downloads dataset contains the aggregated number of downloads per day.</description>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over two weeks since my ggcharts package has been published on CRAN. As you can imagine I am curious to see how many people actually use the package. While there is no way to actually measure the usage, the number of package downloads seems like a good proxy to me.
CRAN Logs Getting data on the number of package downloads is fairly easy thanks to the cranlogs package.</description>

      <title>Adding labels to a ggplot2 bar chart</title>

      <description>I often see bar charts where the bars are directly labeled with the value they represent. In this post I will walk you through how you can create such labeled bar charts using ggplot2.
The data I will use comes from the 2019 Stackoverflow Developer Survey. To make creating the plot easier I will use the bar_chart() function from my ggcharts package which outputs a ggplot that can be customized further using any ggplot2 function.</description>

      <title>Transform a ggplot2 axis to a percentage scale</title>

      <guid>/posts/ggplot2-percentage-scale/</guid>
      <description>When plotting a variable whose unit of measure is percent it&amp;rsquo;s best practice to have the axis labels contain the percentage sign (%). This makes it obvious to anyone looking at the data visualization that they are dealing with percentages.
To illustrate this let&amp;rsquo;s create an example dataset.
library(dplyr)data(mtcars)cyl &amp;lt;- mtcars %&amp;gt;%count(cyl) %&amp;gt;%mutate(pct = n / sum(n) * 100) %&amp;gt;%print()## # A tibble: 3 x 3## cyl n pct## &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;## 1 4 11 34.</description>

      <title>Always display the current date in an Rmarkdown report</title>

      <description>Rmarkdown is a great tool for creating data-driven reports that have to be updated on a regular basis. To communicate to stakeholders that the report is indeed up to date it&amp;rsquo;s important to display the current date below the title.
An obvious solution to display the current date is to update the date field in the YAML header manually before knitting. But this is both error prone and you are likely to forget about it.</description>
