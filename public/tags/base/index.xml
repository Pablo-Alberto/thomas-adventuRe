      <description>In R, assign() is one of those functions that common wisdom says you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using. My aim in this blog post is to convince you that assign() can be very handy.
The pharmaceutical industry, which I work in, is still SAS dominated so my primary data source at work are .sas7bdat files. Thus, whenever I use R the first thing I have to do is read in those files.</description>

      <title>Is a library the same thing as a package?</title>

      <description>In R you use the library() function to load a package. Thus, surely a package and a library must be the same thing, right?
Actually no, they are not!
So, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between the two? A library is nothing but a folder on your computer in which installed packages are saved. Just like a real library that contains books. It is merely a container. A library on its own is useless.</description>

      <description>To check for missing values in R you might be tempted to use the equality operator == with your vector on one side and NA on the other. Don&amp;rsquo;t!
If you insist, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a useless results.
x &amp;lt;- c(1, NA, 3)x == NA## [1] NA NA NAInstead use the is.na() function.
is.na(x)## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE</description>

      <title>What does the &lt;&lt;- operator do?</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using R for a while, chances are high you came across the &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- operator. On several occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve heard or read people calling &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- the &amp;ldquo;global assignment operator&amp;rdquo;. However, this is wrong. Let me elaborate why.
First, have a look at this example.
x &amp;lt;- 0foo &amp;lt;- function() {x &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- x + 1x}foo()## [1] 1foo()## [1] 2x## [1] 2Here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- truly behaves like a global assignment operator.</description>

      <title>Loading vs. attaching a package</title>

      <description>R users often talk of loading a package when they use library(). But technical library() doesn&amp;rsquo;t load the package but attaches it. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used the :: operator, e.g. dplyr::filter(), you have loaded a package. Loading a package does exactly what the name suggests: it loads all functions and datasets of a particular package. However, to access these functions and datasets you will still need to use :: every time you refer to something within the package.</description>
