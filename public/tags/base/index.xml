      <description>In R you use the library() function to load a package. Thus, surely a package and a library must be the same thing, right?
Actually no, they are not!
So, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between the two? A library is nothing but a folder on your computer in which installed packages are saved. Just like a real library that contains books. It is merely a container. A library on its own is useless.</description>
