      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to announce that {mdthemes}—my second R package—is now available from CRAN. {mdthemes} adds support for rendering text as markdown to the themes from {ggplot2}, {ggthemes}, {hrbrthemes}, {tvthemes} and {cowplot}. All themes start with md_ followed by the name of the original theme, e.g. md_theme_bw().
I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to put this package on CRAN for quite some time but I had to wait until {ggtext}—which does all the hard work for {mdthemes}—was available from CRAN.</description>

      <title>{ggcharts 0.2.0} is on CRAN</title>

      <description>Introduction A week ago the second release of my {ggcharts} package was published on CRAN. {ggcharts} aims to get you to your desired plot faster. It provides a high-level interface for creating common plots using {ggplot2} and does the heavy lifting for you. The resulting plots are ggplot objects so you can further tweak them using any {ggplot2} function.
Major new feature: themes The major focus of version 0.2.0 was adding themes to the package.</description>

      <title>Loading vs. attaching a package</title>

      <description>R users often talk of loading a package when they use library(). But technical library() doesn&amp;rsquo;t load the package but attaches it. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used the :: operator, e.g. dplyr::filter(), you have loaded a package. Loading a package does exactly what the name suggests: it loads all functions and datasets of a particular package. However, to access these functions and datasets you will still need to use :: every time you refer to something within the package.</description>
