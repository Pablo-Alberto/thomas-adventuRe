      <description>R users often talk of loading a package when they use library(). But technical library() doesn&amp;rsquo;t load the package but attaches it. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used the :: operator, e.g. dplyr::filter(), you have loaded a package. Loading a package does exactly what the name suggests: it loads all functions and datasets of a particular package. However, to access these functions and datasets you will still need to use :: every time you refer to something within the package.</description>
