      <description>As a statistical programmer working on clinical trials data I frequently have to calculate change from baseline. In clinical trials baseline is typically defined as the last measurement prior to a clinical trial subject receiving any study drug. Change from baseline is frequently calculated for laboratory measurements, e.g. hemoglobin concentration in blood.
SAS is still the standard used to program datasets in the pharmaceutical industry but R is catching up. Recently, I derived change from baseline for the first time in R.</description>
